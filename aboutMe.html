        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jose Arteaga. I am currently a Fourth year at UC San Diego,
            studying Mathematics - Computer Science. I am music lover who really enjoys listening 
            to rock and metal, specifically Spanish Rock. If there was a band I would call my 
            all time favorite, it would be Soda Stereo. Due to this interest, I also enjoy playing 
            Electric and Acoustic guitar, and some bass ocassionally. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            I like hitting the gym
            and watching UFC. Another hobby of mine is videogames, although I did take a break
            from it. My favorite titles are The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Super Smash Bros
            Ultimate.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like going out, whether it is a big hangout or small and I am always willing to
            meet new people. Feel free to message me and have a conversation with me. Looking forward to
            it.
