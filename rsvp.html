    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a website that was used as an online invitation for a Quinceañera Event.
        The website has a homepage where the user can register for the event. It shows an input form
        where it required the user to input their Name, amount of people in their party, and their 
        phone number. When submitting, it takes you to a custom page that tells you your information 
        has been saved. Another detail that is not showned in the image was a countdown to the event.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Hoteles</i> tab shows information of nearby hotels for the guests to stay at. The <i>Misa</i> 
        tab shows information about the mass taking place. Lastly, the <i>Salon</i> tab shows information about
        the venue.

    <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
    <p>
        This project involved mainly HTML and CSS, with a little bit of javascript in the background
        and an API called web3forms for storing information. Web3forms sends the information from your form 
        to an email you provide. From there, I can see what the user inputted. I deployed the website using github pages 
        and bought a custom domain for a year.
