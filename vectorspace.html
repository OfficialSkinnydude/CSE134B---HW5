    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Users face linear, quadratic, and absolute value problems based on the difficulty. 
        When a user is faced with a problem, they can input parameters to an equation using the game keypad. 
        When the user hits the submit button, the graph they plotted is shown on the screen and 
        they move on to the next minigame depending on correctness.
    </p>
    <h3>Matching Minigame</h3>
    <p>
        Users have to draw lines from boxes with answers to boxes with equations. 
        On submission, they receive feedback on incorrect submissions via an AI model 
        generating explanations for the equations.
    </p>
    <h3>Maze Minigame</h3>
    <p>
        Users have to correctly select steps to solve each equation on screen between three choices within the time limit. 
        This game also uses an AI model for equation feedback.
    </p>

    <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
    <p>
        For this project, I worked on both the equation-generation engine and the game logic. 
        Early on, I built a command-line prototype that generated and evaluated simple linear equations. 
        As the project evolved, my teammate and I adopted the cortex-js/compute-engine library, 
        which let us represent equations using MathJSON and generate step-by-step solutions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My main contributions were cleaning and refining the step-generation pipeline, 
        removing parsing-only steps and ensuring that only meaningful algebra steps were shown, 
        and implementing a full SolveX() function that isolates variables using MathJSON operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also resolved multiple logic bugs related to step descriptions, equation updates, and transitions. 
        On the front-end, I added display messaging, fixed timer and transition issues, 
        and improved the overall game flow so the player receives correct feedback without overlapping events. 
        I also formatted raw MathJSON steps into readable text for players. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I contributed both algorithmic logic and front-end polish to create a smooth math-puzzle game.
