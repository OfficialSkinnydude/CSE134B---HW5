    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a firefox extension that allows UCSD students to import their course schedule to
        Google Calendar with a click of a download. No csv downloads necessary. This can save a students
        time by no thaving to input everything manually. Simply click on "import schedule", sign in 
        with the google account you need, and click "Import Schedule" again. Simple as that. 
    </p>
    <h4>Scope of Work</h4>
    <p>
        The duration of this project was a about a month of work. It started with me learning javascript and 
        HTML. I learned the concept of "Manipulating the DOM", which is important for webscraping. I made a 
        javascript program to scrape the course schedule using the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the courses had been scraped, the courses are then stored in a hashtable.
        We have a function that handles parsing that course data, organizing it by discussions, midterms, and finals, as well
        as course code, professor, etc.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the course have been parsed, the Google Calendar API comes in. We have functions that create 
        events using the API. Now before all this info can be process, we must handle Google Auth2.0.
        <b>This was the hardest part</b>. After many hours of figuring it out and looking at source code,
        the Authoraztion was setup. After signing in with Google, the events are then processed with
        the API and voilà, your schedule is set and imported.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a website that was used as an online invitation for a Quinceañera Event.
        The website has a homepage where the user can register for the event. It shows an input form
        where it required the user to input their Name, amount of people in their party, and their 
        phone number. When submitting, it takes you to a custom page that tells you your information 
        has been saved. Another detail that is not showned in the image was a countdown to the event.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i>Hoteles</i> tab shows information of nearby hotels for the guests to stay at. The <i>Misa</i> 
        tab shows information about the mass taking place. Lastly, the <i>Salon</i> tab shows information about
        the venue.
    </p>
    <h4>Scope of Work</h4>
    <p>
        This project involved mainly HTML and CSS, with a little bit of javascript in the background
        and an API called web3forms for storing information. Web3forms sends the information from your form 
        to an email you provide. From there, I can see what the user inputted. I deployed the website using github pages 
        and bought a custom domain for a year.
